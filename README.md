# this repo is archived because I turned the project into a botnet-ish thing. The new repo can be found here:https://github.com/p0syd0n/dobbyserver
A remote access trojan that uses Flask to host a server, which hosts instructions for the infected machine to then go and get.

The server can be hosted on replit, which I would recommend because it is easy and fast to set up. The client code will be added in a few days after I finish making this repo look presentable.

The server comes with a web interface which is very crudely and badly made because I am a backend person.
