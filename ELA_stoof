Chap 3!!!: (find pages)
P: In chapter 3, Harry has run from his house for fear he has broken the law. Harry ends up seeing a black figure between a few houses. However, before it can aproach, Harry falls and summons the night bus. I predict if Harry did not summon the night bus, the series could of been over. That character clearly might be someone very bad, so if help did not come he could have been dead.
